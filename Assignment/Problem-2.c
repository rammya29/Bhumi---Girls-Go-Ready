/* Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
Data members
1 - Name
2 - Age
3 - Phone number
4 - Address
5 â€“ Salary
Create a method named 'printSalary' which prints the salary of the members.
Two classes 'Employee' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Member' class. The 'Employee'
and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department'
respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an
employee and a manager by making an object of both classes and print the same.  */
